Shard
-----

Shards are the top level object in Promgen which contain both Services and
Prometheus servers

Service
-------

A service in Prometheus is a group of related Projects and are assigned to a
specific shard

Projects
--------
Projects are one of the main groupings for Promgen. This represents a typical
monitoring target and brings together a collection of servers (Farm) with
Exporters and URL endpoints

Farm
----
Farm is a group of servers. Farms may be updated using :doc:`discovery plugins </plugin/discovery>`

Notifiers
---------
:doc:`Notifiers </plugin/notification>` are used for routing messages to a specific destination such as Email or
LINE Notify

Rule
